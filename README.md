# Full Stack Booking Web App Demo

this project is a collection of 2 repos

* ReactJs Client - on Typescript
* ExpressJs Backend - on Vanilla Javascript

> to keep things quick and simple **Sqlite3** is used for Database

# How to Run the Code?
* Open 2 terminals on both Dirs (/server & /client)
* For both run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install there respective dependency
* Configure `.env` for both repos (take `.env.example` as baseline)
* Finally run `yarn start` on both
* SERVER: upon first start `fake.db` database will be created automatically with some dummy data which can be configure in `database.js` (server restart recommended)

# What is not included?
it's a very minimal project, so it was obvious to exclude the stuff which were not mentioned in the Guidelines.

additionaly i added JWT on backend because i was eager to learn it.

### Disclaimer
**This is my very first attemp to make a Backend**
Due to time constrains and other important works to be done.
I had to cut corners in the development of this project.
the project is a total prototype and should not be taken as a direct reflection of actual development practice.
for proper code practices head over to brunch-pwa.
